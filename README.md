# NSSP Suicidal Risk Prediction Project :sos:

This project is about predicting the suicidal risk of individuals based on various features like gender, age, and previous attempts using machine learning models.

## Getting Started :rocket:

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites :clipboard:

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

`python==3.8 pandas==1.3.3 numpy==1.21.2 matplotlib==3.4.3 seaborn==0.11.2 scikit-learn==1.0`

### Installing :wrench:

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

1. Clone the repo
`git clone https://github.com/pawaspy/Suicide-Risk.git`

2. Install Python packages
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Running the tests :computer:

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

`python3 suicide_report.py`


## Dataset :file_folder:

The dataset used in this project is the NSSP dataset. Unfortunately, I can't provide a direct link to the dataset as it's not specified where it's located. You might want to check with the data provider or the institution that has the data.
